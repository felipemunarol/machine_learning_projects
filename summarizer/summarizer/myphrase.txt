Ancient Rome traces its origins to the legendary founding by Romulus and Remus around 753 BCE. Initially a monarchy, Rome transitioned to a republic in 509 BCE, characterized by a system of elected officials and a senate.
The Roman Republic expanded through conquest, notably during the Punic Wars against Carthage. This period saw the rise of influential figures such as Julius Caesar and Pompey.
The Republic eventually gave way to the Roman Empire in 27 BCE with the ascent of Augustus, marking the beginning of a period known as the Pax Romana, characterized by relative peace and stability.
The Roman Empire reached its territorial zenith under Trajan in the 2nd century CE, encompassing vast territories around the Mediterranean.
However, internal strife, economic troubles, and invasions by barbarian tribes contributed to the decline of the empire. By the 5th century CE, the Western Roman Empire fell, while the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, endured for another millennium.
Ancient Rome's legacy endures in various aspects of modern society, including law, government, architecture, and language.
